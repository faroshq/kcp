# TILT

Tilt setup for KCP development.
The benefit of using Tilt here is that it can be used to build and deploy the KCP
automatically when code changes are detected. It also provides tools like
Prometheus, Grafana, Loki and port forwarding into local machines for debugging.
It uses a helm chart as a base and injects locally built images into kind cluster

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Tilt](https://docs.tilt.dev/install.html)
- [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)


## Usage

To start tilt run:

```bash
./contrib/tilt/kind.sh

# Output example:
....
Install KCP
Tooling:
Grafana: http://localhost:3333/
Prometheus: http://localhost:9091
KCP API Server: https://localhost:9443
KCP FrontProxy Server: https://localhost:9444
Tilt started on http://localhost:10350/
v0.33.6, built 2023-09-29

(space) to open the browser
(s) to stream logs (--stream=true)
(t) to open legacy terminal mode (--legacy=true)
(ctrl-c) to exit
```

Once tilt starts, press `space` and track the progress. The first boot might take
a while as it needs to build all the images, run prometheus, grafana, loki, etc.

### Prometheus

Full e2e prometheus is not yet integrated as we need metrics secret from KCP:

1. Login into KCP
2. `kubectl get -o=j secret metrics -o json | jq -r ".data.token" | base64 -d`
3. Add this token to `prometheus-values.yaml`
